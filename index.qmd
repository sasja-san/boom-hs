## About this tutorial

This tutorial started as a list of function names on a piece of paper.
The people who worked through the list on the paper greatly appreciated it as an introduction.

This is intended as a short and simple way for someone who has a bit of programming experience^[Mostly made for people doing the AI course at Jönköpings Tekniska Högskola (JTH).] to start at the *right end* of learning Haskell.^[There's way too many "What is a Monad?" tutorials out there. Don't even fuck around with those for your first month. It will be a huge waste of your time.]

To reach basic proficiency you will need to master three things.

  1. The basic syntax of lists and datatypes.
  2. Understanding and writing function type signatures.
  3. Some/most of the functions in `Prelude` and `Data.List`.

This tutorial aims to guide you through these with minimal effort.











## Install GHC
:::{.column-margin}
#### Note On Installing

Using your OS's package manager should be fine for any small school task, but if you ever need a proper install then you should be using the tool [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) which will manage which version of GHC you install.

If you're having trouble installing GHC, use [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
:::

If you have a package manager, preferably use that. It's around 500 MB. The package name is usually just `ghc`.

If you don't have one use [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) but that'll take almost 2 GB.

If you're on Windows then you shouldn't be using this tutorial. You're too far outside the programmer culture in general for this to help you. Is there any real chance for you to save your soul? Repent and better your ways.^[Stack has instructions for Windows as well.]













## Tutorial Name

![](img/older-meme-but-checks-out.jpg)

Haskell files have the extension `.hs`.
"HS" is also short for [something else, as seen in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olm7xC-gBMY).
Coincidentally, at the end of the linked video you can see the average student reaction as he tries to learn Haskell.
